      "It doesn’t matter how hard you work, if your attitude is bad, you won’t get very far. It’s important to show that you care about your work and that you are willing to go the distance to get the job done. A good way to keep a positive attitude is to work on projects that are interesting to you. It sounds obvious, but many people will agree to roles they have no interest in. Playing it safe wont make you a great developer! Do your job well for you, not for them. When you start in this profession, the usual thing is to start as a junior developer without earning much money. No matter how hard you try, it won’t be easy to make rapid progress in your company, especially if it’s a small company. If you want to improve your skills and quickly increase your salary, change jobs often, searching for a better position. ",

      "Carefully select the technologies you want to work with. Aim to become an expert in a couple - but competent with many. Research skills carefully and you can future-proof your career. I’ve answered a question about this on Quora which you may want to take a look at. Always follow coding standards and write code that is understandable and commented where necessary and can be passed on to someone else easily. This was always important but in the remote age, it’s essential. Learn how to read the documentation. The rush to use something makes us not read the documentation well or understand the API correctly. If you want to do something right without wasting time, don’t take shortcuts. Read the documentation well. Otherwise, you probably won’t do things in the best possible way. Be critical of Stack Overflow, Google, and other sources. Don’t just copy the solution, understand it.",

      "There is no point in being an expert in dates tech. You should be highly competent with Agile development, task management software (Jira, Trello…), version control (Git..), and different environments (local development environment and working knowledge of deploying applications). Invest in good tools and your workspace. This is fundamental. If your work computer is slow, it will take you longer to get things done, and time is money. If your monitor is small, you will not be able to divide the screen into different screens, and again, you will waste your time. Invest in a good chair, a big monitor that you can divide into several screens when programming, and in a powerful computer. This may seem very expensive, but over time it saves you a lot of money. With this setup you can do more projects on your own, finish the tasks you have to do sooner, and your back doesn’t get hurt. So you have more time for sports and don’t need to get a back massage, and at night eyes are more rested, and you can enjoy reading in bed.",

    body:
      "Good communication skills directly correlate with good development skills. The ability to communicate is crucial for understanding problems clearly, being able to break them down into hypotheses and propose solutions in a coherent manner. You should be able to learn concepts quickly. And yes this is a skill that improves through practice. If English is not your first language, make sure you know it well and can communicate it effectively. In the world of technology, English is the de facto language of most documentation and developer interactions. If you don’t speak it well enough, interpreters or translators may be required, making your knowledge second hand and easily outdated. Criticize the code, not the person. If a colleague has done something wrong, there are many ways to say so. Never point fingers at the person because you will create enemies forever, not only personally but professionally. Try to help everyone, and improve the code if you think it can be done, but explain the reasons and don’t impose the improvements. Remember that life goes around in circles. Some developers tend to create an immense sense of attachment to what they do, as if their work represents their “baby,” and any criticism of it is taken personally or interpreted as criticism to themselves. Remember that criticism of the code is not a criticism of the person. Just because someone wrote bad code in the past, that doesn’t mean they are a poor developer in the present. The code was or is bad, not the person. Everything can be improved.",

It’s the addition of the soft skills above that make them great. The ability to learn quickly and jump into a project seamlessly, to help others out, to always have a great attitude. These are the skills that make you invaluable to a business. Consider implementing some (or all!) of these characteristics, and you can easily become a good (if not great) programmer much faster. Even within a year, but it depends on how much work you do in that year of course!",
